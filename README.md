**What can this project be linked to?**

**This project can be linked to various different things but in this case, it aim to find a link to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**

There are various approaches to linking ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) efforts with refugee relief.

Investing in or supporting businesses that actively assist refugees by giving them work, education, or help with resettlement is known as social impact investing. These kinds of projects enhance the governance and social dimensions of ESG.

The impact of environmental crises, such as resource depletion or disasters brought on by climate change, is felt by a large number of refugees. Through easing these issues, aiding environmental sustainability can also indirectly benefit refugees.

Advocating for policies that uphold the rights of refugees and ensure equitable treatment is consistent with the ideals of governance. Part of an ESG strategy can include lending support to groups that advocate for equitable governance and refugee rights.

Corporate Responsibilities: Businesses can incorporate employment programs for refugees, providing chances for work as well as assistance. This supports diversity and inclusivity and adds to the social component of ESG.

ESG goals are aligned with supply chain ethics by ensuring that workers, especially those who may be refugees or migrants, are treated ethically across the supply chain. It may be vital to keep an eye on and guarantee ethical work practices and the defense of human rights.

Community Engagement and Integration: Businesses that actively participate in the local communities in which refugees settle by providing services, jobs, or educational opportunities enhance the social components of ESG.

Transparency and Reporting: Businesses can show their support for social causes by disclosing in their ESG reports the work they have done and the results of that assistance for refugees.

A more comprehensive and effective approach to societal and business duties can be achieved by coordinating ESG principles with refugee assistance.
